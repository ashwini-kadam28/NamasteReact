Reconsiliation algoritham also known as react fiber
- Virtual DOM is a representation of  actual DOM
- Search "React fiber architecture"

Why React is fast?
- React is using efficient DOM manipulation bcoz it have virtual DOM
- With "Diff algorithm" React effieiently find out diffrence between virtual DOM and update the UI. it do   efficientllay do DOM manipluations.
- In state variable when setMethod is called react will trigger diff algorithm and re re-render page

--Read optional chaining

# Whenever there is change in state variable, react triggers a  reconcilliation cycle(re-renders)
