 ***Full form is Not a node pacakge manager. 
 npm is the world’s largest Software Library (Registry). npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer.

● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
 **** Parsel gives great development experience, from starting a new project to ierating and debugging and shipping to production.
      Features: - Dev Build
                - Local Server
                - HMR = Hot Module Replacement(as soon as save file changes are available on webpage)
                - File Watching Algorithm - written in c++
                - Caching - (Faster Builds)
                - Image Optimization
                - Minification of production build
                - Bundling
                - Compress
                - Consistant Hashing
                - code splitting
                - Diffrential Bundling - support older browsers
                - Diagnostics
                - Error Handling
                - Https

                
● - What is `.parcel-cache`
  ****Parcel space — On installing parcel. parcel-cache takes some space
The .cache folder (or .parcel-cache in parcel v2) stores information about your project when
 parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything
  from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode. I think committing 
  it to git would be a bad idea - it would add a large number of (unnecessary) changes to your commit
   history, and it could easily get out-of-sync with the code that generated it.

● - What is `npx` ?
The npx stands for Node Package Execute and it comes with the npm, 
when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically npx will installed.
 It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm 
 registry without even installing that package.

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
***1 -"dependencies" is an obecjt taht contains library, which your project requires for production envionments and functioning effectively.
      -"devDependencies" are those packages in the package.json file that you need only forBabel, Webpack,  etc.
    2  -"dependencies" you require these package to test and run your project on localhost
     -"devDependencies" These types of dependencies are required during the web application devlopment process but not while testing or executing it.
     3- "devdependencies" you can add dependencies to the package.json file by runnig the below command
        npm install <dependencies>
      -"devdependencies" for npm install <dev_dependencies> --save- dev

● - What is Tree Shaking?
    Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.
    An unused export or import will be dropped.

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
    Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.
    Save valuable development time by only updating what’s changed.
    Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser’s dev tools.


● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?  
● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
● - What is the `dist` folder?
    Folder to generate builds. Dist keeps files minified for us.
    Npx parcel build index.html
● - What is `browserlists`
